                    <h2>Pamela Lim</h2>
                </div>
                <p>My name is Pamela Lim, and I was an award-winning and well-known entrepreneur in Asia in the late 1990s and early 2000s who became a university lecturer for the last decade. Over the next five years, I will focus my research on Education.</p>
                <p>I decided to take a course on Web Applications knowing that there will be a final project, and I'd like to take that opportunity to build a web application to do an adaptive Math testing system. I hope to get good advice and insights from experienced programmers and do at least a prototype during the course.</p>
                <p>My experience in programming is varied. I started my career as a programmer in 1990 with Citibank, designing and programming ATMs. We used PL1, COBOL, Assembler in those days.</p>
                <p>I subsequently moved on to become a business woman, and employed hundreds of programmers in seven countries. We were early adopters of the object oriented technology in mid-1990s. Afterwhich, I listed the company and retired into a university to teach entrepreneurship and raised five children.</p>
                <p>Over the last few years, I have engaged a few programmers to do work for me. Have been quite disappointed, so I picked up programming myself to fill that gap. I've picked up C sharp, used the MVC stuff in Visual Studio, learned Java, learned Javascript and found out how HTML/CSS work. I have also taken courses in cloud computing. I hope to get up to speed on programming just to implement some systems. I find that it is much faster to code than to explain and ask people to code. I have also explored CMS like Moodle, Drupal and Joomla, and wrote some simple extensions. All self-taught.</p>
                <p>I like working on Linux, but since the platform used in the class is xampp, I will be using a PC. I also like to use Microsoft Azure, but will take this opportunity to learn Digital Ocean this semester. Happy to learn anything!</p>
